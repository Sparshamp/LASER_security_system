# LASER_security_system

This project is a smart security system using Arduino that integrates laser tripwire detection, password-based access via a keypad, and motion detection using a PIR sensor. It activates a buzzer alarm when unauthorized access is detectedâ€”such as a broken laser beam, motion while armed, or incorrect password entry. The system also features an LCD for real-time feedback and supports optional data logging and analysis through a Python GUI. It's ideal for home, office, or lab security and is a great demonstration of real-time embedded systems and sensor integration.

The two python files are for Tkinter GUI, ardino.py is only for GUI whereas doorlock_gui.py contains code for both GUI and MongoDB data storage.
